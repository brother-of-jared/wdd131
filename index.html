            <p>Hello, my name is Mahonri Balajadia, and I am from the Philippines. I am one of five children and recently got married in the temple. My hobbies are playing sports, gaming, reading, singing, and watching. When I was young, my siblings and I helped our parents with their printing business. They hired a tutor for us to learn some basic troubleshooting with computer and printers so whenever there's a problem we don't have to call for a technician or bring the computer or printer to a repair shop. I'm really grateful to have that experience because that is where I started to develop my passion with the modern technology. I'm taking this class because I want to learn the knowledge and skills to become a web developer. I'm looking forward to working with all of you this semester. Good luck to us!</p>

            <p>The Philippines is a beautiful Southeast Asian archipelago of over 7,600 islands, known for its white-sand beaches, clear waters, and lush landscapes. It blends Asian, Spanish, and American influences, creating a rich culture seen in its traditions, food, and warm hospitality. With vibrant cities, stunning natural wonders like Palawan and Siargao, and a joyful, resilient people, the Philippines offers a unique mix of adventure, history, and charm.</p>
